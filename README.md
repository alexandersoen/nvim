# nvim config

New year, new neovim config.
A minimal setup with the main stuff here.
Plan is to have `lua/alexandersoen/core/languages.lua` as the main spot to add language options.

## TODO
Some TODOs I should get around doing at some point.
In order of importance (?), not necessarily in implementation order.

- [ ] Python setup.
- [x] Tab complete / suggestions (Switched to blink.cmp).
- [x] Setup `folke/trouble.nvim`.
- [x] Setup `mbbill/undotree`.
- [x] Some type of colour scheme.
- [ ] LLM / Agentic memes ?
- [x] Change from netwr to oil.nvim.
- [x] Add some gitsigns
